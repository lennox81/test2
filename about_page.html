	  <p>Why choose us?</p>
	  <ul style="width: 800px; margin: 0px; display: inline-block;">
		<li style= "margin-bottom: 7px">We are able to pay more than other house buying companies. Our relationships allow us to pay you more for a house and allows us to still make a return on our investment.
		<li style= "margin-bottom: 7px">Instead of putting your house on the market and waiting weeks for a buyer then paying thousands of dollars in commisions and fees you can get a no-obligation cash offer from us.
		<li style= "margin-bottom: 7px">Having to keep your house in 'selling condition' or make make repairs so that you can constantly be ready to show it, We buy as-is. Then hoping that one of those buyers will qualify for a loan.
		<li style= "margin-bottom:"> I'm involved in every sale. Why deal with some big corporation that is only looking at the bottom line if you don't have to? I genuinely want to help you get out of a painful situation.
